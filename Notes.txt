java script is server side and client side language or also know as scripting language for browser and its working on the latest standard ECMA 6 
   java script Execuation context
In java script we have to Execuation context 
1.Global Execution contest 
2.function Execution context 
 java script is single threade language and all the program execuation happend in three phase 1. golbal execuation context 
 2.memory allocation phase 
 3.execution phase 
 for execuation we will take one example 
  let a = 3
  let b = 5
  function addNum (num1,num2){
   return num1+num2
  }
    addNum(a,b)
    addNum(3,4)
this is a example we take 
now first all the code will execution happend in the golbal scope in this key word all the code execuate 
after golbal scop execution will goes into the memory phase where all veriables name stored along with the 
undefiend like 
  a = undefiend 
  b =undefiend 
  but for the function it will be the different 
  addNum = defination 
  and same for addNum = undefiend 
  then all the the code enters into the execuation phase 
  where all the logics and the allocation of the values happend a assigned the 3 and b assigned 5 so far so on when
   the code comes on the line 15 then it take to the addNum where the all the logic is alredy difiend and it will fill
   the no and return the value to addNum same for down one also and so far so on and if the nested loops is there 
   it will execuate the all loop till end and after execution all the stored values is deleted 
             
             
              control flow















































            1.veriable
In javaScript we have three ways  to write the veriabls let,const,var 
the differance between these three keywords is that the scop of the code and the 
update for example let and const having block scope and the var having global scope means 
if you want to update tha var you can update any where you want in the code 
because of this we are facing to many issues for updating the code but in let key word
you can update but you can't redefined the veriable and const you can't  update after 
decliration and scope of this let and const veriable is block scope 
            2.Data Type and Memoery Mangment 
 In java Script we have 8 data type and divided into  two types 
 1.premative data type 
 2.non-premative data type 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1.premative data type 
  we have 7 types of preamative data type 
  1.string (nothing but the words or the latter )
  2.null (null is not initalize and the type of null is object)
  3.undefiend (undefined is nothing but the not defined)
  4.BigInt (BigInt is used to represent long number )
  5.boolean(true and false)
  6.number(the number is range of 0 to 2power of 53)
  7.symbol(sybole is used full for the unique values)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.non-premative data type 
 IN non-premative data type we have three types of 
 1.object 
 2.function
 3.array
 this is non-premative data types in the java Script 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory mangment in the java script 
As  we saw the data types in the javaScript and they are different from one main compnent like memory managment 
in java script or in computer  we have two types to store data 
1.Heap memory 
2.stack memory
